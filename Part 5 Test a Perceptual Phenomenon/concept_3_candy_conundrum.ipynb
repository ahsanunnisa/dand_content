    "I have two bowls of candy. One is supposed to be filled with candy-covered chocolates, the other filled with fruit-flavored candies with candy shells. Unfortunately, someone has nefariously mixed up the contents of the two bowls, mixing a portion of one bowl into the second, and vice versa. Even worse, the candies are visually indistinguishable, and can only be sorted out by taste.\n",

Assume for the questions below that both bowls are large enough that small samples will not have a practical effect on the distribution of candies."
